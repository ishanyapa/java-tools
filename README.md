# java-tools
Here are some tools and projects I have developed using Java.

1) NetworkScanner is a simple Java application which I have developed to scan a LAN. Once the scanner is running, it will display the hosts which are currently up and running. I used NetBeans 8.1 IDE to develop this project, and you can download it and edit it as you want. 

2) DbBackUp is a MySQL database backup tool developed with Java using mysqldump utility provided by MySQL community.
