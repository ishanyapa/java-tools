Here are some tools and projects I have developed using Java.

NetworkScanner is a simple Java application which I have developed to scan a LAN. Once the scanner is running, it will display the hosts which are currently up and running. I used NetBeans 8.1 IDE to develop this project, and you can download it and edit it as you want.
